# 2048 Minus 2048
A small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Gabriele Cirulli's 2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) which is itself based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

Made on the way to making [2K48](http://malcolmocean.github.io/2K48/), but I didn't release it because I didn't find it at all fun. But some friends bugged me to release it, so here it is. [Play it here!](http://malcolmocean.github.io/2048-2048/)
